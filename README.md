# Unison

[cloudflarebutton]

Unison is an anonymous, single-topic message board designed with a minimalist aesthetic. The application provides a serene, focused space for discussion. It operates as a single-page application where users can read a stream of messages and contribute their own without needing an account. The core components are a clean header defining the topic, a simple form for message submission, and a chronologically ordered list of messages. The design prioritizes clarity, generous white space, and subtle interactions to create a calm and inviting user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

To get Unison up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Bun**: A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
*   **Cloudflare Account**: Required for deploying the application.
*   **Wrangler CLI**: Cloudflare's command-line tool for developing and deploying Workers. [Install Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-update/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd unison_board
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Cloudflare Configuration**:
    *   Log in to your Cloudflare account via Wrangler:
        ```bash
        wrangler login
        ```
    *   The project is pre-configured to use a single Durable Object named `GlobalDurableObject` for message storage, as defined in `wrangler.jsonc`. No additional configuration is needed for the Durable Object binding.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### Start the development server

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
bun dev
```

This command will:
*   Start the frontend development server (typically on `http://localhost:3000`).
*   Launch a local Cloudflare Worker environment that simulates the edge, including Durable Object interactions.

### Linting

To check for code quality and style issues:

```bash
bun lint
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

Unison is designed for seamless deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

1.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare**:
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```
    Wrangler will guide you through the deployment process, including selecting your Cloudflare account and zone.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly using the Cloudflare button:

## üåê API Endpoints

The backend, powered by a Hono Worker and Cloudflare Durable Objects, exposes the following main API endpoints:

*   `GET /api/messages`: Retrieves a list of all messages posted on the board.
*   `POST /api/messages`: Submits a new message to the board. The request body should contain the message text.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls and Considerations

While Unison provides a functional and visually appealing message board, it's important to be aware of certain limitations and areas for future improvement:

*   **Spam Vulnerability**: The application currently lacks rate-limiting or user authentication, making it susceptible to spam or abuse.
*   **Scalability**: Fetching the entire message list on every update can become inefficient as the number of messages grows. For a production-scale application, implementing pagination or a more advanced real-time update mechanism would be necessary.
*   **Input Validation**: Although client-side input validation is present, robust server-side validation should be added to prevent invalid or malicious data submissions.
*   **Content Moderation**: Without a content moderation system, the platform could be susceptible to inappropriate content.
